            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup oil</li>     
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a big mixing bowl, whisk sour curd with gram flour (besan) and water. Make a smooth mixture without any lumps.</li>
            <li>Add red chili powder, turmeric and salt.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a kadai, on low flame add fenugreek seeds and asafetida. As soon as fenugreek seeds become pink add green chili, ginger paste and garlic paste. Stir well and add the sour curd mixer with one hand while stirring constantly with the other hand. Do not stop stirring otherwise lumps will form.</li>
            <li>Now lower down the heat stirring constantly till it starts boiling. Let it simmer for 10 -15 minute on low heat or till the kadhi gets thickened. We can adjust consistency of kadhi using water depending how we want.</li>
            <li>Switch off the flame and add the fried pakodas to the kadhi.Rest the kadhi for the pakoras to absorb the kadhi.</li>                   
            <li>Before serving transfer the kadhi with pakoras to a dish.</li>
